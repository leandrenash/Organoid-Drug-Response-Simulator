Organoid-Based Drug Response Simulator
Objective:

Develop a simulation and analysis tool to study how organoids respond to various drugs, incorporating predictions of effectiveness using machine learning models.
Features:

    Organoid Simulation:
        Use PyOrganoid to simulate organoid growth and interactions under controlled conditions.
        Introduce environmental variables like nutrient availability, drug concentration, and time to simulate realistic conditions.

    Drug Response Modeling:
        Simulate how organoids respond to different drug types, varying dosages, and application intervals.
        Include metrics such as cell viability, growth inhibition, and apoptosis rates.

    Machine Learning Integration:
        Use TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-Learn models to predict drug efficacy based on organoid simulation parameters.
        Train a model using real-world datasets (if available) or synthetic data from PyOrganoid simulations.

    Visualization:
        Use libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly to create interactive graphs showing:
            Growth curves.
            Drug response patterns.
            Predicted vs actual outcomes.

    Extendability:
        Allow users to input their drug profiles or adjust simulation parameters.
        Export simulation results for further analysis.

Workflow:

    Set up PyOrganoid:
        Simulate organoid growth and responses under baseline conditions.
        Introduce factors like drug types and concentrations.

    Generate Synthetic Data:
        Simulate various scenarios to create a training dataset for the machine learning model.

    Build a Predictive Model:
        Train a machine learning model to predict organoid responses using synthetic data.
        Validate the model using a separate dataset.

    Create a Visualization Interface:
        Build a simple UI or dashboard using Streamlit for users to visualize simulations and model predictions.
